# Chefonex 

---

Chefonex is a modern online platform that connects passionate home chefs with customers looking for fresh, healthy, and affordable homemade meals. 

Chefonex supports **three user roles**: Admin, Chef, and Customer, each with their own dashboard and permissions. 

Admins have full control over platform management including user moderation, fraud detection, request approvals, order tracking, and platform statistics.

For home chefs, the platform offers a dedicated dashboard to create meals, manage orders, monitor earnings, and grow their cooking business directly from their kitchen — without needing a physical restaurant.

Customers can explore daily menus, check chef availability, view detailed meal information, place orders, make secure payments, and track order status in real time.

The platform includes essential features such as Firebase authentication, JWT-secured API access, role-based routes, Stripe payment system, real-time status updates, review & favorites system, advanced forms using react-hook-form, and a beautifully responsive UI with animations.

Built using the MERN Stack, Chefonex delivers a smooth, secure, and scalable experience for all users.
